## react-meals-app
- it's a simple responsive front-end app that have some meals and their prices.
- user can choose the quantity of the meal he wants
- after choosing his meals he can press on the cart icon and revise  his order
- the next step is to proceed to payment but it's not connected to back-end yet.
- I've developed this app as a part of my React.js learning with Max schwarzm√ºller
